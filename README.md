# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository!

This repository contains my personal configuration for devcontainers as well as
any other environment that I can apply these configurations to.

## Usage

To use these dotfiles, you can leverage the `devpod` CLI tool to setup the environment for you
or you can manually copy the files to your home directory.

```bash
devpod up . --dotfiles github.com/teddy-codes/dotfiles
```
